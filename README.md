# FEther Crowdfunding Smart Contract

FEther (Fund Ether) is a decentralized crowdfunding platform. It allows project managers to create campaigns and users to contribute funds to support those campaigns. FEther is built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security in all transactions.

## Features

- **Create Campaigns**: Project managers can create fundraising campaigns, setting a funding goal and a minimum contribution amount.

- **Contribute Funds**: Users can easily contribute to their chosen campaigns by sending Ether. Contributions are tracked and displayed on the campaign page.

- **Vote on Campaigns**: Contributors can vote to approve a campaign. FEther uses a transparent voting system, with contributors having the final say.

- **Automatic Payout**: When a campaign is approved, the smart contract automatically transfers the funds to the campaign lead.

- **Track Contributions**: Users can view their contributions and the progress of campaigns they've contributed to.

## Getting Started with Remix IDE

1. Visit the Remix IDE at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new Solidity file.
3. Copy the smart contract code from [FEther.sol](https://github.com/ganimtron-10/FEther/blob/master/FEther.sol) and paste it into the Remix IDE.
4. Compile the smart contract using the built-in Solidity compiler.
5. Deploy the contract to a test network (e.g., Ropsten) or a local blockchain within Remix IDE.
